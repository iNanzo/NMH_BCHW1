# 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```

## Work Done Summary

I first made sure the images had alt descriptions. After changing around elements for future css use I started the clean up. 
Using the <section> element I was able to clean up and group a majority of the css elements. 
For example, I was able to remove individual classes on the index.html file and group them on singular .content and .benefits css elements that modified the elements themselves.
